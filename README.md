# Phone-Catalogue-App
Itâ€™s a responsive web application about phone catalogues. All the phones will be loaded from database and the user will able to see all the details.
## Front-End 
To create Front-end part, i have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to make the web work efficiently while updating and rendering any components when the data will change.
## Back-End 
For Back-End to create and implement Rest API (that has one ending-point *GET*), i have decided to used [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) ,basically it's a Java-based framework , as it makes the services to develop and deploy independently.

## Tecnology Stack

Component         | Technology Used
---               | ---
| Frontend   | React | 
| BackEnd | Spring-Boot,Java  | 
| Database   | MySql | 
| Persistence   | JPA  | 

## Getting Started
## Running the Application on Localhost using Docker-Compose

### Prerequisites

- Clone the Repository into your Computer.  
- Install the docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ .

### Deployment 
To create and build the docker images ,i have created two DockerFiles ,one for Frontend and other for Backend.
### DockerFile for the React Application   
As the frontend of the application is written in React. so i deployed the React app behind an nginx server.  
Following is the Dockerfile for the React app (It uses nginx.conf):

### Creating the docker-compose.yml configuration

To deploy my docker compose, i created a docker-compose.yml file that contains configuration for all the services in my entire stack.

Following is the docker-compose.yml file To run my application. It has three services: app-server, app-client, and db. The app-server contains configuration for the backend app ,while the app-client contains configuration for the react app, and db is for the mysql database.
