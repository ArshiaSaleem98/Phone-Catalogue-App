# Phone-Catalogue-App

### Direct Access to web (Deployed on Google Cloud Platform): https://phone-catalogue-react-front-sd2e33dvpq-uc.a.run.app/
Itâ€™s a responsive web application about phone catalogues. All the phones will be loaded from database and the user will be able to see all the details.
## Front-End 
To create Front-end part, i have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to make the web work efficiently while updating and rendering any components when the data will change.
## Back-End 
For Back-End, i have decided to used [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to create and implement Rest API (that has one ending-point *GET*),basically it's a Java-based framework , as it makes the services to develop and deploy independently.

## Tecnology Stack

Component         | Technology Used
---               | ---
| Frontend   | React | 
| BackEnd | Spring-Boot,Java  | 
| Database   | MySql | 
| Persistence   | JPA  | 

## Getting Started
## Running the Application on Localhost using Docker-Compose

### Prerequisites

- Clone the Repository into your Computer.  
- Install the docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ .

### Deployment 
To create and build the docker images ,i have created two DockerFiles ,one for Frontend and other for Backend.
### DockerFile for the React Application   
As the frontend of the application is written in React. so i deployed the React app behind an nginx server.  
Following is the Dockerfile for the React app (It uses nginx.conf):

### DockerFile for the SpringBoot Application  

Here is the Dockerfile for the spring boot app:

### Creating the docker-compose.yml configuration

To deploy my docker compose, i created a docker-compose.yml file that contains configuration for all the services in my entire stack.

Following is the docker-compose.yml file to run my application. It has three services: app-server, app-client, and db. The app-server contains configuration for the backend app ,while the app-client contains configuration for the react app, and db is for mysql database.

### Running the complete Stack:

- Open the Project that you have cloned into an IDE  
- Run the app by using the following Command:`docker-compose up`  
- Access the Application:http://localhost:9090/


## Running the Application on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run  

### Prerequisites

- Need to have a gcp (Google Cloud Platform) account and a project : https://console.cloud.google.com/
<img width="573" alt="dockerfilesreact" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45390300/139325765-991b77af-0a3f-4c3e-8805-8a5abbfe5e86.png">  

- Cloud sdk downloaded into your computer.For more info:  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install  
- Clone the repository 

### Set Up

- Open the terminal and type the command: `gcloud init` then select a new configuration option.

- Choose a name for your project
- Select your account and pick the project.

- Open the repository into an editor then go to react folder, and remove the red highlighted files and change the name of green highlighted files into dockerfile and nginx.conf respectively ,as the other files are to run the app on localhost.

- Create a mySql database on any server or any available service , in my case i have used [remotemysql](https://remotemysql.com/) that is easy to use for testing purpose ,but  still not recommended , you can use services like Cloud Sql instead for serious deployments.


### Creating an Image container for Back-End 

- Open the springboot folder into an editor , change the *application.properties* credentials accordingly and build the project again.    
<img width="573" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 19 03 21" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45390300/139326795-a1dbf2c7-85d0-46b1-9d36-b9d08e6e4a5d.png">


- Change the directory to springboot folder.   
- Type the command `gcloud builds submit --tag eu.gcr.io/test-react-springboot/phone-catalogue-springboot-back:latest` where *test-react-springboot* is the gcp project id.

- Now go back to cloud run , create a service ,select the image created for Back-End and set the configuration as shown in the following images.  

<img width="573" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 21 12 34" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45390300/139327145-c32c104d-eb68-4973-a236-264670cf176f.png">

#### Deployment of Back-End Image 

After deploying the back-end image, a base url is generated for our Rest api as seen in the following image:  

<img width="573" alt="imgaeback" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45390300/139349136-7e8a77b5-6898-4736-aa89-3af44bf46797.PNG">


### Creating an Image container for Front-End 

- Open the react folder into an editor , change all http request url from *http://localhost:8080* to the url from last step.
- Type the command `gcloud builds submit --tag eu.gcr.io/test-react-springboot/phone-catalogue-react-front:latest` where *test-react-springboot* is the gcp project id. 
- Now go back to cloud run , create a service ,select the image created for Front-End and set the configuration same as back-end as we have seen earlier. 

#### Deployment of Front-End Image 

After deploying the Front-end image, a base url is generated for our React app ,which can be used to access the app:
