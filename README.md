# Phone-Catalogue-App
Itâ€™s a responsive web application about phone catalogues. All the phones will be loaded from database and the user will be able to see all the details.
## Front-End 
To create Front-end part, i have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to make the web work efficiently while updating and rendering any components when the data will change.
## Back-End 
For Back-End, i have decided to used [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to create and implement Rest API (that has one ending-point *GET*),basically it's a Java-based framework , as it makes the services to develop and deploy independently.

## Tecnology Stack

Component         | Technology Used
---               | ---
| Frontend   | React | 
| BackEnd | Spring-Boot,Java  | 
| Database   | MySql | 
| Persistence   | JPA  | 

## Getting Started
## Running the Application on Localhost using Docker-Compose

### Prerequisites

- Clone the Repository into your Computer.  
- Install the docker from https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ .

### Deployment 
To create and build the docker images ,i have created two DockerFiles ,one for Frontend and other for Backend.
### DockerFile for the React Application   
As the frontend of the application is written in React. so i deployed the React app behind an nginx server.  
Following is the Dockerfile for the React app (It uses nginx.conf):

### DockerFile for the SpringBoot Application  

Here is the Dockerfile for the spring boot app:

### Creating the docker-compose.yml configuration

To deploy my docker compose, i created a docker-compose.yml file that contains configuration for all the services in my entire stack.

Following is the docker-compose.yml file to run my application. It has three services: app-server, app-client, and db. The app-server contains configuration for the backend app ,while the app-client contains configuration for the react app, and db is for mysql database.

### Running the complete Stack:

- Open the Project that you have cloned into an IDE  
- Run the app by using the following Command:`docker-compose up`  
- Access the Application:http://localhost:9090/


## Running the Application on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run  

### Prerequisites

- Need to have a gcp (Google Cloud Platform) account and a project : https://console.cloud.google.com/

- Cloud sdk downloaded into your computer.For more info:  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install  
- Clone the repository 

### Set Up

- Open the terminal and type the command: `gcloud init` then select a new configuration option.

- Open the repository into an editor then go to react folder, and remove the red highlighted files and change the name of green highlighted files into dockerfile and nginx.conf respectively ,as the other files are to run the app on localhost.

### Creating an Image container for Back-End 

- Open the springboot folder into an editor , change the *application.properties* credentials accordingly and build the project again.

- Change the directory to springboot folder.   
- Type the command `gcloud builds submit --tag eu.gcr.io/test-react-springboot/phone-catalogue-springboot-back:latest` where *test-react-springboot* is the gcp project id.
