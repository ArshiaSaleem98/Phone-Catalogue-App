# Phone-Catalog-App
Itâ€™s a responsive web application about phone catalogs. All the phones will be loaded from database and the user will able to see the details related to the phone.
## Front-End 
To create Front-end part, i have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to make the web work efficiently while updating and rendering any components when the data will change.
## Back-End 
For Back-End to create and implement Rest API (that has one ending-point Get), i have decided to used [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) ,basically it's a Java-based framework , as it makes the services to develop and deploy independently.
